##What's this

Provides tools to validate an XML document against a set of XSD schemas in Javascript. Under heavy development, so things might change quickly. Usage examples are coming soon.

##Requirements

Defined in a [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) format, so you need an AMD loader.

Uses: 

 - [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
 - [wicked-good-xpath](https://code.google.com/p/wicked-good-xpath/)
 - [requirejs-text](https://github.com/requirejs/text)
 - Some of my own projects: [kapa-xsd](https://github.com/bazmegakapa/kapa-xsd), [kapa-objTools](https://github.com/bazmegakapa/), [kapa-Library](kapa-Library).

##Tests

Tests are written in Jasmine and I run them with Karma.

##Documentation

All the methods are documented with [JSDoc3](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc), you can find the generated HTML documentation in the **docs** folder.
