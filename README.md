##What's this

Provides tools to validate an XML document against a set of XSD schemas in Javascript. Under heavy development, so things might change quickly. Usage examples are coming soon.

##Requirements

Defined in a [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) format, so you need an AMD loader.

##Tests

Tests are written in Jasmine and I run them with Karma.

##Documentation

All the methods are documented with [JSDoc3](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc), you can find the generated HTML documentation in the **docs** folder.
